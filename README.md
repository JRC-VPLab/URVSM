# Universal Retinal Vessel Segmentation Model

## Universal Vessel Segmentation for Multi-Modality Retinal Images (TIP 2025)

arXiv: [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06987); IEEE Xplore: [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218739).

The three new multi-modal retinal vessel segmentation datasets are available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17874693).

We are diligently preparing for the code, they will be available very soon.
